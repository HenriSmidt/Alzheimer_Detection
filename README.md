# Alzheimer's Disease Detection in MRI Scans using Computer Vision

## Project Description

This project focuses on the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in MRI scans using advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for managing and potentially slowing the progression of the disease. By leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision, this project aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease with greater accuracy and efficiency.

## Introduction

Alzheimer's Disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, which can be detected through MRI scans. Traditional methods of diagnosis rely heavily on manual interpretation by medical professionals, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting Alzheimer's Disease from MRI scans using state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the OASIS-1 (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies) dataset, which includes MRI scans from a cross-sectional collection of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96. The dataset includes both healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, providing a comprehensive set of images for training and evaluating the model.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The MRI scans are preprocessed to standardize the images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation to increase the robustness of the model.
